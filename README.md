## 🚀 What I Build

### AI-Powered Applications
- **Multi-agent systems** with LangChain, RAG pipelines, and LLM integrations
- **Intelligent document analysis** — CV parsing, SOP/LOR evaluation, academic guidance
- **Context-aware AI** using vector databases (FAISS) and semantic search

### Modern Web & Mobile
- **Full-stack apps** with Next.js, React, FastAPI, and Express
- **Real-time systems** using WebSockets and Socket.IO
- **Secure platforms** with E2E encryption, JWT auth, and cryptographic protocols
