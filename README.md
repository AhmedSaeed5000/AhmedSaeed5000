# Hey, I'm Ahmed Saeed Mirza 

**Full Stack Developer** crafting fast, modern **AI-powered web applications**.

I build intelligent systems that solve real problems — from multi-agent AI architectures to end-to-end encrypted platforms. My stack spans cutting-edge AI frameworks, modern web technologies, and rock-solid DevOps practices.

## What I Build

### AI-Powered Applications
- **Multi-agent systems** with LangChain, RAG pipelines, and LLM integrations
- **Intelligent document analysis** — CV parsing, SOP/LOR evaluation, academic guidance
- **Context-aware AI** using vector databases (FAISS) and semantic search

### Modern Web & Mobile
- **Full-stack apps** with Next.js, React, React Native (Expo) FastAPI, and Express
- **Real-time systems** using WebSockets and Socket.IO
- **Secure platforms** with E2E encryption, JWT auth, and cryptographic protocols
